# pydv

Collection of Python code to experiment with D-STAR.

Provides the `dv-recorder` and `dv-player` executables that connect via DExtra to some XRF reflector (tested only with xlxd), to record and play back .dvtool files.

Based on [ircDDBGateway](https://github.com/g4klx/ircDDBGateway) and [xlxd](https://github.com/LX3JL/xlxd).
